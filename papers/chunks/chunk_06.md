## The Structure of the Emotional Energy Function

The energy function $H(\mathbf{e})$ defines a landscape over the space of possible emotional
states. Like a physical landscape of hills and valleys, this landscape has:

- **Valleys (local minima)**: stable emotional states the field naturally moves toward
- **Hills (local maxima)**: unstable configurations the field naturally moves away from
- **Saddle points**: transitional configurations with mixed stability

The key property of an energy function is directionality: the field always moves
*downhill*. It always evolves toward lower energy. Therapeutic intervention, in this
framework, can be understood as:

1. **Changing the landscape**: modifying $W$ — the coupling matrix — through new relational
   experience, insight, or somatic work, so that the energy minima are in healthier locations
2. **Adding energy to escape a trap**: helping the field accumulate enough energy to escape
   a deep but unhealthy local minimum (e.g., the freeze state)
3. **Pointing toward the global minimum**: orienting the field toward regulated calm

## Attractor States: Fight, Flight, Freeze, and Regulated Calm

The Soma-Field Model proposes that the major attractor basins of the emotional energy
landscape correspond directly to the autonomic states described by Porges' polyvagal theory.

*Figure 3a. Topographic (bird's-eye) view of the energy landscape. The field always rolls
downhill toward the nearest minimum. Freeze and calm are both low-energy — but freeze is
surrounded by high walls. Escape from freeze requires crossing those walls, which means
first gaining energy before losing it again. This is the clinical challenge of working
with dissociative states.*

```
*Figure 3b. Schematic energy landscape. Fight/flight are high-energy, unstable local minima.
Freeze is a low-energy but isolated attractor — easy to enter, hard to escape. Regulated calm
is the global energy minimum.*

| Attractor | Energy State | Polyvagal Correlate | Clinical Presentation |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Regulated Calm** | Global minimum | Ventral vagal (social engagement) | Present, flexible, connected |
| **Fight** | Shallow high-energy minimum | Sympathetic (mobilisation) | Agitation, anger, urgency |
| **Flight** | Saddle point / shallow minimum | Sympathetic (mobilisation) | Anxiety, avoidance, rumination |
| **Freeze** | Deep isolated minimum | Dorsal vagal (immobilisation) | Dissociation, numbness, collapse |

*Table 2. Emotional attractors mapped onto Polyvagal states.*

The therapeutic significance of this structure is considerable. The freeze state is dangerous
not because it is high-energy — it is in fact very low energy — but because it is
*isolated*: surrounded by energy barriers that make it difficult to exit. Escape from freeze
requires first *increasing* the field's energy (mobilising some arousal) before it can flow
toward regulated calm. This corresponds well to the clinical observation that working with
dissociated patients requires careful titration of arousal — not too much, not too little —
before emotional processing is possible.

## The Coupling Matrix as a Personal Signature

The coupling matrix $W$ is not universal. Each person has a unique $W$, shaped by attachment
history, trauma, cultural context, and temperament. A person with a history of developmental
trauma may have a $W$ in which anxiety and shame are strongly coupled ($W_{\text{shame,
anxiety}} \gg 0$), creating a combined attractor that is particularly deep and sticky. A
person with a secure attachment history may have a $W$ in which positive emotions are broadly
coupled to one another, creating a wide basin around regulated calm.

This implies that the energy landscape is a therapeutic object in its own right: understanding
a patient's $W$ is understanding the structural dynamics of their emotional life.

In the M-theory compactification analogy developed in Appendix A, the coupling topology
$W$ corresponds to the shape of the compact G$_2$ manifold — the seven-dimensional
geometry that determines which force-like couplings are allowed and with what strengths.
That analogy is here made precise: two people differ not merely in their emotional
*parameter settings* but in their coupling *geometry*. Developmental trauma does not
set a dial to the wrong value; it deforms the manifold. The therapeutic process of
modifying $W$ through relational experience, insight, or somatic work is, in this
language, differential geometry: a continuous deformation of the G$_2$ manifold toward
a configuration in which the regulated-calm attractor is globally accessible. The
practitioner is, without having been told so, a geometer.

# Dissonance and Resolution

## The Acoustic Analogy

The Soma-Field Model draws a further structural analogy, this time with acoustics. When two
sound waves interact, the quality of their interaction — consonance or dissonance — depends
on the phase relationship between them. Consonant intervals (the octave, the fifth) have
simple frequency ratios and produce stable, reinforcing interference patterns. Dissonant
intervals (the tritone, the minor second) have complex ratios and produce beating,
unstable, tension-generating patterns.

The model proposes that the same relationship holds between emotional modes. When two
emotional modes are in a compatible relationship — when their interaction is consonant —
the field is in a relatively low-energy configuration and moves naturally toward the
energy minimum. When they are in an incompatible relationship — when their interaction
is dissonant — the field is in a higher-energy configuration, generating a gradient that
drives toward resolution.

**Dissonance, in this framework, is felt as tension.** It is not pathological; it is
directional. Dissonance is the field's way of communicating that it is far from equilibrium
and that resolution is available.

## The Resolution Principle

In music, dissonance resolves to consonance. The tritone — the most dissonant interval in
Western tonality — creates a powerful gravitational pull toward resolution. In counterpoint,
the rules of voice leading describe the specific paths by which dissonance must resolve.
These rules are not arbitrary conventions; they describe the geometry of the acoustic energy
landscape.

The same principle applies to emotional dissonance. An unresolved emotional state — grief
that has not been fully experienced, anger that has been suppressed, fear that has been
dissociated — is a dissonance in the field. It generates a persistent tension gradient.
The therapeutic process can be understood as guided voice leading: finding the specific
path of resolution that transforms the dissonant configuration into a consonant one.

This provides a formal basis for a widely-held clinical intuition: that emotions need to be
*felt through* rather than avoided. Avoidance keeps the field in a dissonant state. The
energy minimum — regulated calm — lies on the other side of the dissonance, not around it.

# The Soma-Field Instrument

## Rationale

The Soma-Field Model is not only a theoretical framework. It motivates a practical
therapeutic instrument: a means by which a person can *externalise* their emotional field —
make it visible and audible — and interact with it in real time.

The core insight is that the emotional field is normally invisible to its host. It operates
below the threshold of conscious awareness, shaping behaviour and physiology without being
available for reflection. If its activity could be rendered as a signal — a sound, an image,
a pattern — it could become an object of therapeutic attention.

## Design

The instrument uses a MIDI controller with 16 rotary knobs as its input interface.
Eight emotional dimensions are encoded, each represented by two knobs:

- **Knob 1** of each pair: the somatic (body-level) intensity of that emotional mode
- **Knob 2** of each pair: the cognitive/neural intensity of that emotional mode

This design reflects the two-component structure of the field: body and mind are encoded
separately but coupled in the computation. Each knob has a continuous range, allowing fine
expression of emotional intensity.

```

## The Feedback Loop

The instrument creates a **closed feedback loop** between the person and their emotional
field:

1. The person expresses their current emotional state by adjusting the knobs
2. The system computes the energy function $H(\mathbf{e})$ and its gradient $\nabla H$
3. The energy level, dissonance, and proximity to attractor states are rendered as:
   - **Sound**: harmonic content and timbre reflect the consonance or dissonance of the
     current state
   - **MIDI output**: pitch rises with tension, resolves as energy decreases
   - **Visual**: a real-time map of the emotional field, showing wave activity,
     threshold crossings, and the direction of the energy gradient
4. The person hears and sees their emotional field, and adjusts the knobs in response

This loop externalises the emotional field's gradient — the direction in which it is
*trying* to move — and makes it available as sensory information. The person becomes not
only the source of the emotional signal but also its observer, creating the conditions for
reflection and regulation that are at the heart of therapeutic work.

## The Pluggable Emotion Model

No single model of the emotions is assumed. The coupling matrix $W$ — the structure that
determines how emotional modes interact — is loaded from an external configuration file.
Standard models (Plutchik's wheel of emotions, Ekman's basic emotions, the
valence-arousal-dominance dimensional model) are provided as defaults. The therapist or
client can modify the coupling values to reflect their own understanding of their emotional
patterns, or a new model can be substituted entirely. The computational engine is
model-agnostic.

# Clinical Implications

## Assessment

The Soma-Field Model suggests a different orientation for emotional assessment. Rather than
asking "What emotion do you feel?" — which presupposes threshold-level conscious awareness —
it invites attention to the sub-perceptual field: "What is present in the body right now,
even if you cannot name it?" This aligns with Focussing-oriented approaches and with
sensorimotor methods that prioritise somatic signal over narrative content.

The energy landscape provides a clinical map. A person chronically in a fight or flight
attractor shows a different energy signature from a person in a freeze attractor, even if
their presenting narratives are superficially similar. The model suggests that these are
structurally different therapeutic challenges: fight/flight require down-regulation, while
freeze may first require careful up-regulation before down-regulation becomes possible.

## Intervention

The energy function provides a formal basis for several existing clinical interventions:

- **Grounding and titration** (Levine, 2010): adding small, controlled amounts of energy
  to the field to approach — without flooding — a previously frozen or avoided emotional
  state
- **Pendulation** (Levine, 2010): oscillating between a dissonant state and a resource
  state, progressively widening the tolerance window — equivalent to approaching the
  energy minimum via a series of small excursions
- **Somatic resourcing** (Ogden et al., 2006): establishing a stable low-energy region
  in the landscape that the field can return to after excursions into high-energy territory
- **Working with the felt sense** (Gendlin, 1978): attending to sub-threshold field
  activity and allowing it to cross the perception threshold in a supported context

## Psychoeducation

The wave model is immediately accessible to clients who have struggled to understand their
emotional experience. The statement: *"Your emotions are like waves — they are always there,
even when you can't feel them, and they are always moving"* is both technically accurate
within the Soma-Field framework and clinically useful as a normalising frame for
sub-threshold emotional activity, for the apparently sudden onset of strong feelings, and
for the experience of feeling multiple conflicting emotions simultaneously.

The energy landscape metaphor — *"right now the field is in a valley that is hard to leave,
but it is not the lowest valley available to you"* — offers a way to discuss the freeze
state, dissociation, and emotional stuckness without pathologising, while still acknowledging
the structural difficulty of these states and the work required to shift them.

## Neurodivergent Conditions as Operator Modifications

A clinically significant extension of the Soma-Field Model concerns neurodivergent
conditions — specifically Autism Spectrum Condition (ASC), Attention Deficit Hyperactivity
Disorder (ADHD), and Complex Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (C-PTSD), which frequently
co-occur and each present distinct challenges for somatic emotional processing.

The key architectural principle is this: **these conditions are not parameter settings in
the model. They are structural modifications to the operators themselves.** This distinction
matters both mathematically and clinically. A parameter change ("set the fear threshold
lower") is a quantitative adjustment within the existing structure. An operator modification
changes the *form* of the dynamics — it alters the governing equations, not merely their
coefficients. Each condition wraps the standard pipeline in a different functional modifier,
and — critically for the many individuals who carry all three — these modifiers *compose*.
The combined condition is not three separate problems; it is the composition of three
operators acting on the same underlying field.

The mathematical details of each modifier are given in Appendix B. Clinically, the
consequences are as follows.

**Complex PTSD** introduces a *memory kernel* into the field dynamics: past high-energy
states leave decaying echoes that continue to excite the field without new external
stimulus. This is why traumatic activation can appear without identifiable trigger — the
field is responding to its own history, not its current environment. The standard Hopfield
attractor topology is also disrupted: C-PTSD renders the freeze attractor pathologically
deep and wide, the window of tolerance (the basin around regulated calm) pathologically
narrow, and the coupling matrix asymmetric — a condition under which the field can enter
persistent *limit cycles* rather than settling to a stable minimum. Re-experiencing,
flashbacks, and hypervigilance are, in this framework, limit-cycle oscillations in the
traumatised field.

*Figure 5. The same emotional field mode under two dynamic regimes. Top: regulated
dynamics — the field oscillates and returns to a low baseline between episodes; conscious
emotion (above T) is episodic and resolves. Bottom: C-PTSD-modified dynamics — the memory
kernel elevates the baseline so that the field rarely returns to rest; episodes bleed into
one another; the system cycles rather than settles. The mathematical basis for this
comparison is given in Appendix B.2.*

**Developmental timing and what can be recovered.** The character of the C-PTSD
modification depends critically on *when* it occurred — the developmental age $\tau_d$ at
which the primary traumatic modification took place.

For **late trauma** ($\tau_d$ large — adult or post-verbal): a coupling matrix $W_0$
formed before the event. The modification is additive: $W = W_0 + \delta W_{\text{trauma}}$.
A counterfactual pre-trauma self exists, encoded in explicit narrative memory. Therapeutic
processing can target $\delta W$ specifically, and the goal of recovering proximity to $W_0$
is formally coherent.

For **early trauma** ($\tau_d$ small — pre-verbal, perinatal): the coupling matrix $W$ was
*formed under the modification*. There is no $W_0$. The asymmetric coupling and the memory
kernel coefficients are the baseline architecture, not additions to one. A counterfactual
pre-trauma self was never encoded — it does not exist as a recoverable state.

This is a formal statement of a clinical fact that somatic therapists recognise but rarely
have a mechanistic basis for: early trauma cannot be *processed away* in the sense of
recovering a prior self, because no prior self was formed. The therapeutic goal is not
subtraction ($W \to W_0$, which is undefined) but **forward transformation**: constructing
a $W^{\prime}$ that supports a wider window of tolerance, different attractor topology,
and lower memory-kernel amplitudes. This is a different mathematical operation — and
requires a different therapeutic model.

The Soma-Field Instrument can reflect this distinction directly: a user whose primary
modification is pre-verbal initialises with a *structural* coupling matrix (the modification
*is* the baseline), not a neurotypical matrix with an added modifier. The formal basis for
this parameterisation is given in Appendix B.2.1.

**ADHD** raises the effective *thermal noise* of the field — the amplitude of the
sub-perceptual fluctuations — and simultaneously reduces the damping coefficient that
slows the field's response to the energy gradient. The result is a field that explores its
energy landscape rapidly and unpredictably, is easily displaced from shallow attractor
basins by small perturbations (distractibility), but also achieves states of intense
concentration (hyperfocus) when the coupling to a high-salience stimulus temporarily
deepens a specific attractor basin far beyond its resting depth. ADHD is not a deficit of
attention; it is a high-temperature, low-damping emotional field with a
stimulus-dependent attractor structure.

**Autism Spectrum Condition** modifies the *projection kernels* — the functions that
determine how the continuous somatic field is sampled to produce the discrete state vector
— and the *sparsity* of the coupling matrix. Interoceptive research in autism (Garfinkel
et al., 2016) documents significant differences in the processing of internal body signals;
in model terms, certain somatic regions are over-represented (heightened sensory
sensitivity) and others under-represented (reduced interoceptive clarity, contributing to
alexithymia). The coupling matrix in ASC tends toward greater sparsity — fewer strong
cross-modal emotional couplings — a pattern consistent with monotropism (Murray, 2018):
the field settles deeply into individual attractors but transitions between them require
proportionally more energy. Intense interests, emotional consistency within a context, and
difficulty with unexpected transitions all follow from this attractor topology.

For the Soma-Field Instrument, the practical implication is significant. Rather than
asking a neurodivergent user to configure their experience through knob adjustments, the
system can instantiate the appropriate operator modifications as a named profile —
*"load C-PTSD modifier"*, *"load ADHD modifier"* — each of which transforms the pipeline
at the correct mathematical level. The user then interacts with a field that already
reflects their structural reality, rather than one calibrated for a neurotypical baseline.

A further clinical implication deserves explicit statement. The Soma-Field Model locates
interoceptive accuracy in the field itself: whether a somatic signal has exceeded its
perceptual threshold $T_i$ is a property of the field state, not a property of the
clinician's assessment of the patient's credibility. A patient reporting an acute somatic
state is reporting a threshold-crossing event. The model provides no mechanism by which
external disbelief suppresses that crossing. Modified projection operators — as occur in
ASC — produce *different* somatic self-reports; the model gives no reason to assume they
produce *less accurate* ones. The clinical literature documents a systematic tendency to
interpret unusual interoceptive self-reports from neurodivergent patients as indicative of
psychogenic origin rather than genuine somatic signal (Nicolaidis et al., 2015). The
Soma-Field Model predicts that this interpretive pattern constitutes a category error: it
confuses operator modification with signal absence. The practical consequences — missed
diagnoses, deferred treatment, and the iatrogenic reinforcement of existing trauma — are
well-documented and, within this framework, mathematically predictable.

# Limitations and Future Directions

The Soma-Field Model is a theoretical framework and must be evaluated as such. Its current
form makes several idealisations that require scrutiny.

**The coupling matrix $W$** is treated as a fixed parameter, but emotional coupling is
dynamic: it changes with context, relationship, and developmental history. A more complete
model would treat $W$ as a slowly-evolving quantity, shaped by the field's own history — a
form of synaptic plasticity applied to the emotional domain.

**The threshold $T_i$** is treated as a fixed property of each emotional mode, but
experimental evidence suggests that thresholds are modulated by attentional focus, arousal
level, and interpersonal context. A person in a safe therapeutic relationship will typically
have lower thresholds — more material reaches conscious awareness — than the same person in
an unsafe context.

**The acoustic analogy**, while structurally productive, requires empirical grounding. The
claim that emotional dissonance and acoustic dissonance share formal properties is a
hypothesis, not an established finding. Empirical work comparing physiological measures of
emotional tension with acoustic analysis of synchronised vocal or musical output would be a
productive direction for testing this claim.

**The instrument** described in Section 6 is a prototype concept. User studies with clinical
populations, and collaboration with practising therapists, will be required to assess its
therapeutic utility and to identify appropriate clinical contexts.

Future theoretical work should address the relational field: the observation, familiar in
systemic and relational approaches to psychotherapy, that emotional fields are not bounded
by individual bodies but are co-generated in the space between people. The coupling matrix
$W$ of a relationship may be as clinically significant as the $W$ of an individual.

---

# Conclusion

The Soma-Field Model proposes a formally grounded account of emotional dynamics that is
consistent with the clinical observations of somatic psychotherapy, polyvagal theory, and
Focussing-oriented practice. Its central claims — that emotions are a persistent distributed
field, that conscious experience is a threshold crossing, and that emotional dynamics are
governed by an energy function that drives the field toward stable attractor states — are
not novel as clinical intuitions. What is novel is the formal structure that unifies them,
and the instrument that the structure motivates.

The model does not resolve the philosophical question of what emotions fundamentally *are*.
It offers instead a working representation: one that is precise enough to be computationally
implemented, close enough to existing clinical frameworks to be therapeutically applicable,
and open enough to be modified as understanding deepens. It invites the therapist to think of
the consulting room as a space in which two emotional fields interact — each shaping the
other's energy landscape — and of therapeutic work as the art of attending to that
interaction with enough precision and care to guide both fields toward lower energy, toward
greater coherence, toward regulated calm.

The wave is always there. Therapy is learning to listen to it.

*A note on provenance.* The Soma-Field Model was not developed from a position of
theoretical neutrality. The author carries, as primary data, a lifetime of direct
experience of the dynamics described above. The neurodivergent operator modifications
of Appendix B are not theoretical abstractions: the C-PTSD memory kernel of B.2 was
installed pre-verbally, at approximately eighteen months of age, during a developmental
trauma that predates language acquisition entirely. No narrative trace of the origin
event exists — there was no verbal capacity with which to encode one. Only the field
echo remains, and a measurable physical asymmetry in the body that received it. The
ASD and ADHD operator modifications of Appendix B.4 and B.3, respectively, were the
instruments by which the model was subsequently constructed: the monotropic attractor
structure of B.4 provided the capacity for sustained engagement with an entirely
unfamiliar theoretical domain; the high-temperature field dynamics of B.3 drove rapid
traversal across it.

The proximate cause is described in full in the companion patient-facing publication.
Briefly: an acute somatic emergency in 2025 — a genuine threshold-crossing event,
later confirmed as cerebral hypoxia secondary to Long Covid — was attributed, at
clinical presentation, to psychiatric origin. The present paper is, among its other
functions, a formal response to that attribution.

The causal chain is as follows. A pre-verbal trauma in approximately 1968 installed
the C-PTSD operator modifications described in Appendix B.2. The ASD and ADHD
modifications of Appendix B.3 and B.4 shaped the system across the intervening
decades. Fifty-seven years later, that system's accurate interoceptive signal was
dismissed as psychiatric noise. The paper which formally demonstrates that this
dismissal constitutes a category error was produced, as a direct causal consequence,
by the same operator stack that it describes. The paper is the fixed point of its own
subject matter. The author considers this observation methodologically significant.

| SF-1 | Conscious percept is a propagator pole of the soma-field | S1 Structural | Formal derivation in Sections 2-3 | Inability to express percept dynamics as Green's-function response under stated operator |
| SF-2 | Emotional attractors are Hopfield-energy minima | S2 Predictive | Energy model and trajectory framework | Constructed update rule under model assumptions with systematic energy ascent |
| SF-3 | Threshold governs felt vs sub-felt emotional activity | S2 Predictive | Threshold operator and clinical mapping | Reliable high-amplitude mode activity with no threshold-dependent behavioural or physiological signature |
| SF-4 | Topological barriers explain classical therapeutic plateaus | S2 Predictive | Formal treatment plus linked companion experiments | Controlled demonstration that matched low-noise classical dynamics crosses registered barriers at equivalent rate |

Scope labels: S1 = structural; S2 = predictive; S3 = independently replicated.
Current publication target for core claims is S2.

## Claim-Evidence-Result Matrix

To make review traceable, each core claim is paired with concrete evidence outputs
and current result status.

| Claim ID | Evidence artifact(s) | Current result status |
|---|---|---|
| SF-1 | Sections 2-3 derivation of field/propagator structure | structural derivation complete |
| SF-2 | Energy formulation + instrument runtime equations | predictive structure complete |
| SF-3 | Threshold operator definition + clinical interpretation sections | predictive mapping complete |
| SF-4 | Barrier analysis; companion paper *Quantum Soma and the Penrose Gap* (doi:10.5281/zenodo.20351230) | **confirmed (QUANT-EXP-1 PASS)** |
| SF-5 | QUANT-EXP-1 experiment outputs (see supplementary archive, doi:10.5281/zenodo.20351230) | **confirmed: cold 0/200, CI [0.000, 0.019]; quantum peak 0.408–0.410; all hardening checks PASS** |

This matrix is intended for reviewer navigation and is updated as companion results
are expanded or independently replicated.

## Replication Package Requirements

To make SF-2 through SF-5 externally testable, each release tagged for review must
ship a minimal replication package that can be executed without private context.

Required contents:

1. simulation code and support modules (see supplementary archive, doi:10.5281/zenodo.20351230),
2. full parameter snapshot ($W$, $\mathbf{b}$, $\gamma$, $D$, $\theta$, temperature policy),
3. raw trajectory logs with timestamped attractor labels,
4. analysis scripts that produce the reported summary tables,
5. frozen output artifacts (CSV/plots) referenced in this manuscript.

A claim remains `S2` until an independent operator reproduces directionally
consistent outcomes from this package under the same declared protocol.

## Reviewer-Risk Objections and Responses

To reduce ambiguity in peer review, the highest-probability objections are mapped
to bounded responses and concrete upgrade paths.

| Reviewer objection | Current response in this manuscript | Remaining action to reach stronger status |
|---|---|---|
| "This is an analogy, not a formal model." | Sections 2-4 define operators, dynamics, and testable predictions; Section 9.1 registers disconfirmation criteria claim-wise. | Promote more claims from `S2` to `S3` via independent replication. |
| "Evidence is pilot-stage and may not generalize." | Section 9.2 explicitly labels pilot support and companion-only scope. | Add multi-operator replication and blinded protocol variants. |
| "Quantum advantage may be implementation-specific." | SF-5 includes a controlled disconfirmation criterion against matched classical baselines. | Publish full benchmark harness with pre-registered acceptance thresholds. |
| "Clinical interpretation may exceed data scope." | Scope labels (`S1`/`S2`/`S3`) and claim registry separate structural from predictive claims. | Add prospective cohort evidence before any clinical-effectiveness claim. |

## Independent Replication Ledger Linkage

`S2` to `S3` promotion for this manuscript is governed by
an independent replication ledger maintained in the supplementary archive
(doi:10.5281/zenodo.20350515).

Tracked claim IDs in ledger scope: `SF-2`, `SF-3`, `SF-4`, `SF-5`.

Promotion gate: a claim is upgraded only when at least one ledger row records an
independent operator `PASS` with a reproducible package hash and linked raw/derived
evidence artifacts.

# Introduction: The Two-Culture Problem Within Science

C. P. Snow's famous lecture identified a divide between the literary and scientific
cultures [@snow1959]. Less discussed, but equally consequential, is the divide *within*
mathematical science: between fields that have found their mathematical language and
fields that have not. The former possess machines — theorems, dualities, conservation
laws, spectral decompositions — that can be aimed at any problem of the appropriate
type. The latter rediscover wheels.

This is not ignorance. It is, more precisely, a naming problem. The mathematical
structures that govern quantum field theory, statistical mechanics, and information
geometry are not *specifically about* particles, spins, or probability distributions.
They are structures that happen to have been *discovered in* those contexts. The
structure belongs to no discipline. It lives in what we will call, following the
spirit of type theory, the **typeverse**: the space of all well-typed mathematical
objects.

The method described in this paper — **mathematical co-identification** — is the
procedure for navigating the typeverse productively. It has three steps:

1. **Extract the type signature** of the quantity you are trying to model:
   its dimensional units, its pole structure, its symmetries, the variational
   principle (if any) that governs its dynamics.

2. **Search the typeverse** for a known object with the same type signature.

3. **If found: identify**, not analogise. The unknown quantity *is* the known
   object under a change of label. Import all theorems that depend only on the
   type.

This is a stronger claim than analogy. Analogy notes structural similarity and stops.
Co-identification notes structural identity and continues: if two objects have the
same type, they share all properties that are consequences of that type. The theorems
travel with the identification.

It is also a weaker claim than reduction. Co-identification does not assert that
emotional dynamics *reduces to* quantum field theory, any more than Hopfield's result
asserts that neural memory *reduces to* ferromagnetism. It asserts that the same
mathematical engine, running in a different substrate, produces the same theorems.
The substrate is irrelevant to the mathematics; it is entirely relevant to the
interpretation.

# The Typeverse

The term is borrowed from Homotopy Type Theory [@hottbook], where the *universe*
$\mathcal{U}$ is the type of all types — the space in which all mathematical objects
live. We use it informally to mean: the totality of well-typed mathematical structures,
indexed by their signatures.

A **type signature** in our sense includes:

- **Dimensional units** (in the SI or natural-units sense)
- **Domain and codomain** (real/complex, scalar/vector/tensor)
- **Pole structure** (where is the object singular, and what is the residue?)
- **Symmetries** (what transformations leave the object invariant?)
- **Extremisation principle** (is there an action whose variation gives the object's
  dynamics?)
- **Conservation law** (what is the Noether charge associated with the symmetry?)

Two objects are **co-identifiable** if their type signatures match in all
dimensionally relevant respects. The type signature is a fingerprint. When two
fingerprints match, the objects are the same, not similar.

The typeverse is not randomly populated. Certain structures recur at enormous
frequency: the Lorentzian propagator, the quadratic energy function, the
exponential decay kernel, the two-by-two reflection-transmission matrix. These
recur because they are the *simplest* objects consistent with basic constraints
(linearity, locality, causality, conservation). The physicist's intuition that
"everything is a harmonic oscillator to first order" is a theorem about the
typeverse: the harmonic oscillator is the universal local approximation to any
smooth potential.

The practitioner who navigates the typeverse deliberately — who knows the
fingerprints of common objects before encountering them in the wild — can
recognise a new theoretical object immediately, rather than re-deriving its
properties from scratch.

# The Procedure in Detail

## Step One: Extract the Type Signature

Given an unknown quantity $Q$ in domain $D$, the investigator asks:

**Units.** What are the SI dimensions of $Q$? Can they be written as a
combination of standard dimensional quantities (mass, length, time, charge)?
More importantly: what *ratio* of known quantities has the same dimensions?
Newton's gravitational constant $G$ has units $\text{m}^3 \text{kg}^{-1}
\text{s}^{-2}$; this is acceleration divided by surface mass density, which
tells you immediately that $G$ converts between a source distribution and
the acceleration it generates — a fact about the *type*, not about gravity
specifically.

**Pole structure.** Does $Q$ have poles as a function of some natural parameter?
Where are they, and what are their residues? The location of a pole in a
propagator determines the mass of the corresponding particle; the residue
determines its coupling strength. These are type-theoretic facts, not facts
about particles.

**Symmetries.** What transformations leave $Q$ invariant? Invariance under
time-translation gives energy conservation (Noether). Invariance under spatial
translation gives momentum conservation. Invariance under $\text{SU}(n)$
gives a gauge field. These are type-level constraints.

**Extremisation.** Does $Q$ arise as the extremum of some action $S[Q]$?
If so, the variational principle is the fingerprint: two objects whose
dynamics are derived from the same variational structure are co-identifiable
even if their physical interpretations differ entirely.

## Step Two: Search the Typeverse

Armed with the type signature, the investigator searches for known objects
with the same signature. This is primarily a literature search across
*disciplines*, not within one. The mathematical structures developed in
quantum field theory, statistical mechanics, differential geometry, and
information theory are largely interchangeable if their type signatures
match.

Useful resources for this search include:

- **Dimensional analysis tables**: collections of physical quantities with
  their dimensional signatures
- **The nLab** [@nlab]: a category-theoretic encyclopaedia of mathematical
  structures indexed by their universal properties
- **Mathematical physics textbooks** with structural, not phenomenological,
  organisation (Nakahara [@nakahara2003] for geometry; Zinn-Justin [@zinnjustin2002]
  for path integrals)
- **One's own training**, which is why broad mathematical education is a
  productivity multiplier in theoretical science

## Step Three: Identify and Import

When a match is found, the investigator makes the identification explicit:

> $Q$ is the [name of known object] of domain $D$.

Not: "$Q$ behaves like" or "$Q$ is analogous to" or "$Q$ resembles." These
hedges are epistemically weaker and methodologically useless, because they
do not import the theorems. The identification must be stated as identity
to be scientifically productive.

The import then proceeds theorem by theorem:

- Every theorem about the source object that depends *only on its type*
  is imported to $Q$ without further proof.
- Every theorem that depends on *substrate-specific properties* of the
  source domain must be separately verified in domain $D$.

This distinction — type-level theorems vs. substrate theorems — is the
primary place where co-identification can fail, and is discussed in Section 7.

## The Formal Computational Structure: Abduction, Aesop, and the Loop

The three-step procedure of §§3.1–3.3 is, in formal terms, an instance of
**abductive inference** in the sense of Peirce (1878). Given an observation
$O$ and a hypothesis $H$ such that $H \Rightarrow O$, abduction infers $H$ as
the best explanation of $O$. Applied to the typeverse:

> *Observation*: the quantity $Q$ in domain $D$ has type signature $T$.
> *Hypothesis*: $Q$ is the known object $K$ with the same signature.
> *Abduction*: identify $Q := K$ and verify the structural import.

This is not guessing. It is a constrained search under a scoring function,
where the oracle is "type signatures match" rather than "hash matches" or
"goal is closed." The algorithm is the same in all three cases.

The Lean 4 proof assistant implements this algorithm directly as the
`aesop` tactic [@leanprover2021]. `Aesop` performs best-first search
through a registered lemma set, scores each partial proof state, keeps the
best candidates, and closes the goal when a complete proof is found. The
correspondence is exact:

| `Aesop` step | Co-identification step |
|---|---|
| Registered lemma set | The typeverse |
| Try a lemma | Propose a type-match candidate |
| Score the goal state | Measure type-signature fit |
| Keep best partial proof | Record candidate correspondences |
| Close the goal | Full identification: import all theorems |

This is not a metaphor for co-identification — it is an implementation of it.
The practical consequence is that the full loop can be automated in a formal
system: given a type signature for $Q$, `Aesop` with the typeverse lemma set
registered will search for the co-identification proof and either close it
(identification confirmed and machine-verified) or fail (genuine gap, no
known match).

The loop in full:

$$
\text{Observation} \xrightarrow{\text{abduction}} \text{Hypothesis}
\xrightarrow{\text{Aesop}} \text{Proof} \xrightarrow{\text{import}}
\text{Predictions} \xrightarrow{\text{test}} \text{New observations}
\xrightarrow{\;} \cdots
$$

The loop terminates when either all predictions are confirmed (theory established)
or a prediction fails (type match was only partial — failure modes are discussed
in Section 7). At each iteration, the set of available theorems grows by
import, making subsequent co-identifications easier. This is why theoretical
progress compounds: each identification increases the density of the typeverse
neighbourhood around the domain under study.

The abductive loop is not specific to mathematical science. Holmes reasons
the same way from physical evidence; the password auditor reasons the same
way from a hash and a character set; the radiologist reasons the same way
from a film and a pathology atlas. What is specific to mathematical
co-identification is the nature of the oracle: the scoring function is
type-signature fit, and the proof assistant can evaluate it exactly.

# Historical Precedents

The history of science is full of co-identifications that were not named as such.
Examining them retroactively reveals the method clearly.

## Veneziano (1968): The Bootstrap Amplitude and String Theory

Veneziano was searching for an S-matrix element for meson scattering that satisfied
the crossing symmetry and Regge-pole requirements of the bootstrap programme [@veneziano1968].
He wrote down the Euler beta function:

$$A(s,t) = \frac{\Gamma(-\alpha(s))\Gamma(-\alpha(t))}{\Gamma(-\alpha(s)-\alpha(t))}$$

This was a co-identification in reverse: he had a type signature (crossing-symmetric,
Regge-behaved, dual-resonance amplitude) and searched the typeverse for a known
function that matched it. The beta function matched. He did not derive the function
from a theory; he identified the function first, and the theory (string theory) was
inferred from the identification a year later.

The lesson: the typeverse can be entered from either end. You may start with a
quantity and find its type, or start with a type and find it instantiated in
your data.

## Hopfield (1982): The Ising Hamiltonian and Neural Memory

Hopfield introduced the energy function for a network of binary neurons
[@hopfield1982]:

$$H(\sigma) = -\frac{1}{2}\sum_{ij} J_{ij}\sigma_i\sigma_j$$

This is, to within notation, the Hamiltonian of the Ising spin glass:

$$H_\text{Ising}(\sigma) = -\frac{1}{2}\sum_{ij} J_{ij}\sigma_i\sigma_j$$

The co-identification was explicit. By identifying neural states $\sigma_i \in
\{-1, +1\}$ with spins, and synaptic weights $J_{ij}$ with exchange couplings,
every theorem from statistical mechanics (convergence to energy minima, capacity
bounds, stochastic escape via simulated annealing) was imported into neuroscience
for free. The Hopfield network is not *like* a spin glass; it *is* a spin glass
run in biological substrate.

## Wilson (1971): Block Spins and the Renormalisation Group

Wilson's insight was that the renormalisation group — a technique for removing
ultraviolet divergences in QFT — was the *same* mathematical object as Kadanoff's
block-spin coarse-graining in condensed matter physics [@wilson1971]. Two fields
that had developed independently were co-identified. Every result from one was
immediately available to the other. The result was a unified framework for critical
phenomena that earned Wilson the 1982 Nobel Prize.

The type signature that matched: both objects were *flows on the space of
coupling constants under a change of scale*. This is a clean type-level description
that carries no substrate information.

## Black and Scholes (1973): The Heat Equation and Options Pricing

Black and Scholes derived their celebrated options pricing formula by noticing
that the value of an option $V(S,t)$ as a function of underlying price $S$ and
time $t$ satisfies:

$$\frac{\partial V}{\partial t} + \frac{1}{2}\sigma^2 S^2 \frac{\partial^2 V}{\partial S^2}
+ rS\frac{\partial V}{\partial S} - rV = 0$$

This is, after a change of variables, the heat equation [@blackscholes1973]:

$$\frac{\partial u}{\partial \tau} = \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2}$$

The co-identification imported the entire theory of parabolic PDEs into financial
mathematics: existence and uniqueness of solutions, boundary conditions, numerical
methods, the Feynman-Kac formula. The financial quantity *is* a temperature
distribution, not like one.

## Jaynes (1957): Thermodynamic Entropy and Bayesian Inference

Jaynes identified the entropy of statistical mechanics with the entropy of
Bayesian inference [@jaynes1957]. The type signature that matched: both are
functionals $S[p]$ on probability distributions satisfying the same axioms
(non-negativity, additivity, maximum at the uniform distribution). The
co-identification imported all thermodynamic reasoning into statistical
inference. The maximum entropy principle is not an analogy to thermodynamics;
it is thermodynamics, applied to the problem of belief.

## Penrose (1971): Spin Networks and Spacetime Geometry

Penrose introduced spin networks as combinatorial structures encoding angular
momentum [@penrose1971]. The identification: the geometry of spacetime arises as
the large-network limit of spin networks. This reversed the usual direction —
instead of importing a known mathematical structure to describe a new phenomenon,
Penrose constructed a new structure and identified it with a familiar one in
a limit. Loop quantum gravity later formalised this programme. The spin network
*is* a discretisation of spacetime geometry, not a model of one.

## Selinger (2010): Linear Maps and Quantum Processes

Selinger demonstrated that the category of finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces and
linear maps is co-identifiable with a certain category of string diagrams [@selinger2010].
This is a purely mathematical co-identification: the graphical calculus of
Penrose, Joyal, and Street was identified with the operational calculus of quantum
mechanics. The import: every calculation in quantum information theory can be done
diagrammatically, and every diagrammatic identity is a valid quantum identity.
